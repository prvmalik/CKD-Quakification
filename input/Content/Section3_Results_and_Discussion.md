The method for generating CKD populations was evaluated for predicting pharmacokinetics in subjects with CKD using PBPK-CKD modeling for three test compounds (gabapentin, acebutolol, and atenolol). 

Each subsection that follows contains an introduction to the test compound, a description of model development for describing the pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects, and subsequent translation to a population with CKD. Successful prediction of pharmacokinetics in subjects with CKD would qualify the use of the underlying anatomy and physiology parameters for PBPK-CKD modeling.
