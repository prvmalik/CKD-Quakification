The method of generating individuals with CKD and the resulting populations with CKD were qualified by testing their utility for predicting the oral pharmacokinetics of gabapentin, atenolol, and acebutolol in subjects with CKD. In this approach, a healthy population PBPK model is first constructed and evaluated for the test compound. Then the healthy population is adapted or replaced with a CKD population, and predicted pharmacokinetics are compared with observed pharmacokinetic data in subjects with CKD from clinical trials in literature.

Each subsection that follows will contain an introduction to one test compound, a description of the PBPK model development for a healthy population, and the subsequent translation and extension to a population with CKD.
