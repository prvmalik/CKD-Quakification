With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a CKD PBPK model by adapting the healthy population to a population with CKD according to the defined method. 

A population with Stage 3 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Blum 1994 (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after a single oral dose of 400 mg in this target population is presented in Figure 3.1.2.

A population with Stage 4-5 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Blum 1994 (eGFR 0-29 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after a single oral dose of 400 mg in this target population is presented in Figure 3.1.3.
