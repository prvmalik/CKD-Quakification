Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker indicated for hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias. It is administered orally and classified as a BCS Class 3 drug. Acebutolol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 40%. Its elimination half life is 3â€“4 hours.<sup>35</sup>

Acebutolol undergoes extensive first pass metabolism in the liver by two enzymes carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and N-Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2).<sup>36</sup> Other metabolic pathways in the liver that are largely undefined also contribute. Approximately 35% of clearance is through the renal route,<sup>35</sup> and acebutolol undergoes active tubular secretion through the OCT system as demonstrated by a renal clearance that exceeds the maximal filtration rate (167 mL/min).<sup>37</sup> It has a fraction unbound of 0.85 in plasma.
